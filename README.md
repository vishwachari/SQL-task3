## Task - 03 - Basic SELECT Queries

### Overview
This task focuses on writing and executing **basic SELECT queries** in MySQL.  
It demonstrates retrieving data from tables, applying conditions, ordering results, limiting output, and using clauses such as `DISTINCT`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and column aliasing.  

### Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench  

### Objectives
- Use `SELECT *` and column projection  
- Filter data using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`  
- Search with `LIKE` and ranges with `BETWEEN`  
- Sort results with `ORDER BY` (ASC/DESC)  
- Limit rows using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`  
- Remove duplicates with `DISTINCT`  
- Rename columns using aliases (`AS`) 

### Deliverables
- `use-of-DCL.sql` (SELECT queries script) 
- `use-of-DCL.txt` (queries in text format)  
- Screenshots of query results (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, alias examples)  
- Documentation in `README.md`
